Summary</h3>

<p>
Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity 
relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – 
a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify 
how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

</a>The Question / Goal </h3>

<p> 
The goal of the project is to predict the outcome 'class' variable indicating the manner in which these participants did their exercises . 
Any of the other variables can be used to predict with. 
Report should be created describing how the model was built , 
how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is expected to be, and the reasons of the choices. 
You will also use your prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.

The data : Cleaning and Analysing datas</h3>

<p>
First step is loading data in R , understanding the data structure , looking for anomalies and errors , cleaning datas .
Then we can plot data and in case of gaussian distributions we can standardize the variables using means and standard deviations .

then we can plot the variables to understand how they actually look and see if any correlation appear between themselves or with the outcome.

The Features </h3>

<p>You can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>

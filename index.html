Summary</h3>

<p>
Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity 
relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – 
a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify 
how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The Steps </h3>

<p> 
Following the relative importance of steps for building a machine learning algorithm, i will start first by presenting the goal , 
then one of the most important steps wich is the data , then the features and finally the choice of the model
  </p>

The question - Goal </h3>

<p> 
The goal of the project is to build a prediction model to predict the outcome 'classe' variable indicating the manner in which these participants did their exercises . 
Any of the other variables can be used to predict with. 
Report should be created describing how the model was built , 
how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is expected to be, and the reasons of the choices. 
The prediction model will be used to predict 20 different test cases.

The data - Loading - Cleaning -Analysing</h3>
<h5>First of all , we load the training data and testing data in data frames using only relevant columns  </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv">Training data: pml-training.csv.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv">Testing data: pml-testing.csv.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>using read function .The read.csv function assumes by default that  file has a header row, so row 1 should contains the name of each column.
If that's not the case, just add header=FALSE to the command</p>
<p>The read function creates the 'data frame' type objects trainingData and testingData </p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>trainingData= read.csv("myDirectory/pml-training.csv")  # read csv file 
testingData= read.csv("myDirectory/pml-testing.csv")  # read csv file </code></pre>

<p>Get dimension of trainingData and testingData sets</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>dim(trainingData) 
dim(testingData)
</code></pre>
<pre ><code>  ## [1] 19622   153
  ## [1]  20 160  </code></pre>
  
<p>Get columns names and their indexes from TrainingData in order to feed a new data set 
with only relevant variables related to accelerometer for Belt , forearm , arm and dumbell.

<p>
I can now create a new data set containing only the needed variables and the outcome 'classe'from the whole trainingData set 
and then split it for 75% into training set and 25% into testing set 
 </p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>data <- trainingData[,c(40,41,42,154,155,156,63,64,65,116,117,118,160)]</code></pre>

<P>The usual practice in Machine learning is to split the data set into 75% for the training set and 25% for the testing set which is obviously no the case here as testing data ratio is only 20 / (19622+20).
So we will subset this data set into 75% for the training set and 25% for the testing set.</P>
<p>Let us check the data set columns on the 10 first samples</p>

<p>Now we have our data set with the necessary columns but there might be some anomalies in the datas such as non numeric values or missing values</p>

<h5> Plotting predictors</h5>

The Model </h3>

<p>  
Our data are used to predict five categories in classe outcome ( A, B, C, D, E) so we will need a supervised multi class classifier .
If we assume that any small bad deviation of acceleration ( by belt, arm, forearm , dumbbell) in any direction (x,y,z) leads to a bad result 
then there should be for any of these movements ( accelerations) values in a decision tree that should fit the expected result.
This is why a Random Forest should perform well if mtry is correctly fitted.


Let us try with sifferent parameters
number of folds : 5 
repeats : 3 
ntree : 100 trees 
</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>control <- trainControl(method="repeatedcv", number=5, repeats=3)
metric <- "Accuracy"
modelRF <- train(classe~., data=training, method="rf", metric=metric,  trControl=control,ntree=100)</code></pre>

<pre><code> Random Forest 

14718 samples
   12 predictor
    5 classes: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' 

No pre-processing
Resampling: Cross-Validated (5 fold, repeated 3 times) 
Summary of sample sizes: 11774, 11774, 11774, 11776, 11774, 11776, ... 
Resampling results across tuning parameters:

  mtry  Accuracy   Kappa    
   2    0.9384655  0.9221499
   7    0.9323508  0.9144159
  12    0.9172895  0.8953536

Accuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.
The final value used for the model was mtry = 2. </code></pre>
<p>We can see our estimated accuracy is 93.84%.</p>

<p> we can see that the best value for parameter mtry is 2
Let us try again using this parameter mtry = 2 and with ntree = 1000 which should improve the accuracy.

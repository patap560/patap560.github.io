Summary</h3>

<p>
Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity 
relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ 
a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify 
how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. 
They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. 
More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

The Steps </h3>

<p> 
Following the relative importance of steps for building a machine learning algorithm, i will start first by presenting the goal , 
then one of the most important steps wich is the data , then the features and finally the choice of the model
  </p>

The question - Goal </h3>

<p> 
The goal of the project is to build a prediction model to predict the outcome 'classe' variable indicating the manner in which these participants did their exercises . 
Any of the other variables can be used to predict with. 
Report should be created describing how the model was built , 
how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error is expected to be, and the reasons of the choices. 
The prediction model will be used to predict 20 different test cases.

The data - Loading - Cleaning -Analysing</h3>
<h5>First of all , we load the training data and testing data in data frames using only relevant columns  </h5>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv">Training data: pml-training.csv.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv">Testing data: pml-testing.csv.</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>using read function .The read.csv function assumes by default that  file has a header row, so row 1 should contains the name of each column.
If that's not the case, just add header=FALSE to the command</p>
<p>The read function creates the 'data frame' type objects trainingData and testingData </p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>trainingData= read.csv("myDirectory/pml-training.csv")  # read csv file 
testingData= read.csv("myDirectory/pml-testing.csv")  # read csv file </code></pre>

<p>Get dimension of trainingData and testingData sets</p>
<pre class="programlisting"><code>dim(trainingData) 
dim(testingData
</code></pre>
<pre ><code>  ## [1] 19622   153
  ## [1]  20 160  </code></pre>
  
<p>Get columns names and their indexes from TrainingData in order to feed a new training set and a new testing set with only relevant variables related to accelerometer for Belt , forearm , arm and dumbell</p>

<p>Now we have our training set and testing set with the necessary columns but there can be some anomalies in the datas such as non numeric values or missing values</p>

<h5>Once the data are loaded quality must be checked data and data cleaned if necessary   </h5>


<h5>Understanding the data structure :</h5>
<p>


, looking for anomalies and errors , cleaning datas .
Then we can plot data and in case of gaussian distributions we can standardize the variables using means and standard deviations .

then we can plot the variables to understand how they actually look and see if any correlation appear between themselves or with the outcome.
